# Kotlin starter

This project provides a template to bootstrap projects built with Spring Boot and Kotlin.

## Code style

The code style follows the [Kotlin official code conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) and 
are enforced by plugin [Klint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/latest/).

You can configure your IDE as described in the official coding conventions to enforce the rules when coding.
